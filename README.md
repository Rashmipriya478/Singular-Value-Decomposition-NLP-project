What I Learned from the NLP Project using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

In this project, I explored the application of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for natural language processing (NLP). Here are the key learnings:

Understanding SVD and LSA: I gained a deep understanding of how Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) works and its application in NLP, specifically in Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). This technique helps in reducing the dimensionality of text data while preserving the essential features.

Data Preprocessing and Tokenization: I learned how to preprocess text data, including tokenization, lemmatization, and removing stopwords. This step is crucial for cleaning the text and preparing it for further analysis.

Creating Vocabulary and Vectorization: I created dictionaries to map words to integers and vice versa. This helped in converting text data into numerical vectors, making it suitable for machine learning models.

Building the SVD Model: I implemented the Truncated SVD model from sklearn to perform dimensionality reduction on the text data. This step involved transforming the text data into a lower-dimensional space, making it easier to visualize and analyze.

Visualization of Results: By plotting the reduced dimensions, I visualized the relationship between different words. Similar words appeared closer to each other in the plot, demonstrating the effectiveness of SVD in capturing semantic relationships.

This project has enhanced my skills in text processing, dimensionality reduction, and data visualization, providing valuable insights into handling and analyzing large text datasets using NLP techniques.
